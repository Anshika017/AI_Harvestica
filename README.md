# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Model Download

The trained model is available for download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0v36Gh__yR4s_0f55LEdxq2bLghxkqO/view?usp=drive_link). Please ensure you download the file and place it in the correct directory (`backend/plant_disease_detection/trained_model/`).
